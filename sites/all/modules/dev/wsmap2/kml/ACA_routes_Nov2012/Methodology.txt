Mapping the ACA Cycling Routes to a KMZ file that may be viewed on Google Maps


In November 2011 the KMZ file "ACA_Cycling_Routes" was generated.  A tarball was made that included this KMZ file as well as (1) the sub-files used in the process of making this KMZ; and (2) a brief text description of this process.
In November 2012 a new KMZ file "ACA_Cycling_Routes_v2" was generated.  The reason was to reflect changes made to the ACA routes over the last year.

Examination of the GPX files on the Adventure Cycling Association website revealed that 13 of the GPX files associated with the 22 ACA cycling routes had changed.  Therefore new KMZ files were ultimately generated for each of these 13 cycling routes.  Then a new overall KMZ file ("ACA_Cycling_Routes_v2") was made using these 13 new KMZ files plus re-using the KMZ files generated in November 2011 for the other 9 cycling routes.

The GPX and KMZ files for the 13 cycling routes which changed since November 2011 are listed below (the associated files are in the folder "Modified_ACA_Routes"):
*  Adirondack Park Loop
*  Atlantic Coast
*  Florida Connector
*  Great Parks
*  Great Rivers
*  Lake Erie
*  Lewis & Clark
*  North Lakes
*  Northern Tier
*  Pacific Coast
*  Southern Tier
*  TransAmerica
*  Underground Railroad

The GPX and KMZ files for the 9 cycling routes which did not change are listed below (the associated files are in the folder "UnChanged_ACA_Routes").  The files associated with these 9 routes were copied from the November 2011 tarball.
*  Allegheny
*  Grand Canyon
*  Great Divide
*  Green Mountains Loop
*  Sierra Cascades
*  Tidewater Potomac
*  Utah Cliffs Loop
*  Washington Parks
*  Western Express


Viewing the 13 GPX files obtained from the ACA website in Google Earth revealed that only a few changes were needed.  In all cases there was a gap in the route.  This was fixed by joining the constituent sub-routes using the application ExpertGPs.  There were 7 instances of gaps that were joined:
*  Atlantic Coast route:  There was a gap in the overall route in the vicinity of Hyde Park and New Paltz in New York state (just east of the Hudson river).  The two routes that were joined were labeled as "A02190" and "A02200" in the route list; they were combined into a new, longer "A02190" route and the route labeled "A02200" was removed.
*  Great Parks route:  There was a gap in the overall route in the vicinity of Cranbrook, Alberta, Canada.  The two routes that were joined were labeled as "N01090" and "N01120" in the route list; they were combined into "N01120" (and "N01090" became history).
*  Lewis & Clark route #1:  There was a gap in the overall route to the northeast of Kansas City.  The two routes that were joined were labelled as "L01090" and "L01120".  They were combined into the (longer) route "L01120".
*  Lewis & Clark route #2:  There was a gap in the overall route to the southeast of Helena, MT.  The two routes that were joined were labelled as "L05770" and "L05780".  They were combined into route "L05780".
*  Lewis & Clark route #3:  There was a gap in the overall route to the south of Wisdom, MT.  The two routes that were joined were labelled as "L65871" and "L65831".  They were combined into route "L65831".
*  Southern Tier route #1:  There was a gap in the overall route to the west of Tallahassee, FL.  The two routes that were joined were labelled as "H07930" and "H07960".  They were combined into route "H07960".
*  Southern Tier route #2:  There was a gap in the overall route to the northwest of El Paso, TX.  The two routes that were joined were labelled as "H02280" and "H02300".  They were combined into route "H02280".

The writeup below is from the Methodology.txt file that was part of the tarball generated in November 2011.  The process described below was used to generate new GPX/KMZ files for the 13 ACA cycling routes which changed and the KMZ file that includes all 22 ACA cycling routes.

Starting with the GPS data on the Adventure Cycling Association (ACA) website, the goal is to make a KMZ file that has the route data for all 22 ACA routes.  The KMZ format is the one that Google Maps requires as input.

Here is a description of a procedure that will generate the desired KMZ file.

1.  Download the compressed GPX files for each of the 22 ACA routes from the Adventure Cycling Association website (http://www.adventurecycling.org/)

2.  For each of the 22 routes:
(a) un-zip and rearrange the files so that all of the GPX files for a route are in one folder
(b) select all of the GPX files for the route at once and import them into ExpertGPS
(c) in ExpertGPS choose "Routes" from the List pull-down menu
(d) in ExpertGPS's main pane, first select the routes listed and then right-click and select “View in Google Earth” from the pull-down menu
(e) in Google Earth evaluate the overall route just made
(f) in ExpertGPS massage the route data if necessary (see below) then view the results in Google Earth
(g) when pleased with the overall route as it appears in Google Earth, save the overall route as a KMZ file in Google Earth plus also save it as a GPX file in ExpertGPS

3.  Generate the composite file that includes all 22 ACA cycling routes:
(a) load each route individually (in KMZ format) into Google Earth
(b) rename the route (the ACA route name is an obvious choice) so each route has a unique name
(c) in the “Properties” menu for each route, make the line width a value less than 1.0 plus select a color for the route

4.  To complete the process save the set of routes as a KMZ file


Notes:
1. The primary software used in this effort was Google Earth and ExpertGPS map software.  Be sure that the ExpertGPS program is the latest version (there may be errors when ExpertGPS attempts to download the map files for display otherwise).
2. Alternates to the main ACA cycling route are included when possible.  Alternate routes were only removed when they did not display correctly.
3. Most of the routes did not need modifications.  The typical problems encountered were gaps in the route or distant routepoints being improperly connected.  Most of these were resolved by removing a constituent route or by joining adjacent routes.
